            <h2>About the idea</h2>
            <p>
                Climate change is a defining challenge of our time, reshaping ecosystems and human societies in profound ways. 
                Its impacts are particularly acute in the agricultural sector, which is deeply intertwined with the environment and susceptible to shifts in climate patterns.
                Variations in average temperatures, altered precipitation regimes, and the increasing frequency of extreme weather 
                events not only threaten crop yields but also jeopardize food security and economic stability across the globe. 
                As the world's population continues to grow, the demand for agricultural products rises, making 
                it essential to understand how climate change affects agricultural landscapes.
            </p>
            <p><b>
                In this project, we employ machine learning and statistical models to train and predict outcomes such as predicting crop yield based on climate variables, 
                classifying the best adaptation strategy for each region, and estimating the economic impact of climate variability 
                on agricultural practices based on the cleaned dataset.
